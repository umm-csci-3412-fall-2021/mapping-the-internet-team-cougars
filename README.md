## Background

This is a short, self-contained lab that can be a bit of fun when we need
to fill in a day somewhere. We're going to
is use the `traceroute` command and the `dot` graph drawing tool (part
of the [graphiv package](http://www.graphviz.org/)) to map out some
sections of the Internet as it is visible to us from where we're doing
the lab; if you did this from different places you'd see different results.
Your task is to run `traceroute` on several different target hosts around the
world, which exposes a few (a tiny subset, actually) of the routing
paths that exist on the Internet. You'll then massage those results into
a format that you can feed the DOT tool, and DOT can draw pretty graphs
(such as the one on at the top of this write-up; click on it to see it
larger).

And you should check out [this cool xkcd comic](http://xkcd.com/195/)
which shows the allocation of top level domains as of 2006 (which is
  obviously a bit out of date now). The U.S. has
a *lot* of IP addresses...

## `traceroute`

The `traceroute` command takes a destination hostname or an IP address
as an argument, and attempts to infer the route that network packets
take from your
computer to the specified destination. As an example, below is the
result of running `traceroute` from one of the lab machines to `mit.edu`.
The first 13 steps are the "standard" route from UMM to the connection
to the "rest of the world" on the Twin Cities campus. From there we see
the (less predictable) results of routing from there to our destination.
The lines with just '\*'s (19-30) are presumably internal routing points
within MIT that are configured not to reveal their details to outsiders;
when I run `traceroute` from the UK back to our lab, all the routing
boxes in steps 3-9 below show up as just '\*'s.

## DOT/Graphiv

[Graphiv](http://www.graphviz.org/) is a very cool set of tools for
generating graphs described in a simple text format. As a very simple
example, consider the following input file `examples/dot-example.dot`:

    digraph example {
       A -> B;
       B -> C;
       A -> C;
       A -> D;
       B -> E;
    }

Running `dot -Tpng examples/dot-example.dot -o dot-example.png` will
then generate the graph below.

![Simple example DOT graph](examples/dot-example.png)

In the example file the line `digraph example` tells DOT that you're
making a *directed* graph (`digraph`) named "dot-example". (The name
doesn't really matter much.) Most of the remaining lines specify that
there are directed edges from the label on
the left to the label on the right. In the `dot` command the flag `-Tpng`
tells DOT to write out in PNG format. DOT knows a number of graphics
formats, and for *big* graphics (like the ones we'll be generating here)
PDF ( *not* PNG) is probably the most sensible choice. PDF will scale up
and down better for zooming in, and the generated PDF files for large
graphs are *much* smaller than the generated PNG files. (We've used PNG
instead of PDF here because PNGs embed in web pages and PDFs typically don't.)

## Run `traceroute` on several different destinations

We'd like to explore as many different routings as possible, so we want
to run routes to as many different places as possible. Each group is
free to choose to explore destinations as you wish, but you should *at
least* include:

-   A "big name" `.com` destination
    -   It's OK if multiple people hit the same one, because it might
        reveal something useful about how big "cloud computing"
        infrastructures are routed.
-   A `.gov` destination
-   A `.org` destination
-   At least one non-US destination
    -   It can be tricky to know for sure where something is actually
        hosted; I would recommend trying to go to university domains
        since they're almost always run internally (and
        therefore locally).
    -   It would be nice if the class collectively has at least one
        destination on each of the continents.

Run `traceroute` on several different destinations and go through the
output. Feel free to ask questions and point out interesting tidbits
that you discover!

## Generating graphs

Given the output of `traceroute` and the format of DOT files, it's a
fairly straightforward (if somewhat tedious) task to convert the
`traceroute` output into a DOT file. Rather than have you wade through
that, I'm providing you with a Ruby script `scripts/tracerouteDot.rb` (based on a script written by
a student several years ago) that runs `traceroute` on a collection of
domain names and generates a DOT file representing the links discovered
by `traceroute`. The script takes one or
more domain names as command line arguments, runs `traceroute` on each
of those domains, parses the results, and generates the DOT bits. The
output is written to `network_graph.dot`. Running the script can take a
while depending on the number of domains and how many hops are necessary
to get from here to there.

Run the script on your set of domain names, and then run DOT on the file
it generates, i.e.,

       dot -Tpdf -o network_graph.pdf network_graph.dot

Look over the resulting graph. Again, ask questions and share cool stuff. :sunglasses:

You should also look at the DOT file that the script generates, which
might look something like this:

    digraph network {

    "Dungeon" -> "starship33.morris.umn.edu (146.57.33.254)";
    "starship33.morris.umn.edu (146.57.33.254)" -> "mrs-cb-01-gi-1-26.250.ggnet.umn.edu (146.57.237.1)";
    "mrs-cb-01-gi-1-26.250.ggnet.umn.edu (146.57.237.1)" -> "172.25.0.125 (172.25.0.125)";
    "172.25.0.125 (172.25.0.125)" -> "172.25.0.126 (172.25.0.126)";
    "172.25.0.126 (172.25.0.126)" -> "172.25.0.118 (172.25.0.118)";
    "172.25.0.118 (172.25.0.118)" -> "172.25.0.102 (172.25.0.102)";
    "172.25.0.102 (172.25.0.102)" -> "172.25.1.90 (172.25.1.90)";
    "172.25.1.90 (172.25.1.90)" -> "172.25.1.178 (172.25.1.178)";
    "172.25.1.178 (172.25.1.178)" -> "172.25.0.38 (172.25.0.38)";
    "172.25.0.38 (172.25.0.38)" -> "telecomb-bn-02-v3230.ggnet.umn.edu (146.57.238.49)";
    "telecomb-bn-02-v3230.ggnet.umn.edu (146.57.238.49)" -> "telecomb-br-02-v3239.ggnet.umn.edu (146.57.238.50)";
    "telecomb-br-02-v3239.ggnet.umn.edu (146.57.238.50)" -> "telecomb-br-01-te-4-2.ggnet.umn.edu (192.35.86.29)";
    ...
    "gi0-1.colc-rbr1.eastnet.ja.net (193.63.107.41)" -> "essex.site.ja.net (193.60.0.210)";
    "essex.site.ja.net (193.60.0.210)" -> "155.245.47.186 (155.245.47.186)";
    "155.245.47.186 (155.245.47.186)" -> "xps.essex.ac.uk";

    // zeus -> google.com
    "zeus" -> "starship33.morris.umn.edu (146.57.33.254)";
    "starship33.morris.umn.edu (146.57.33.254)" -> "mrs-cb-01-gi-1-26.250.ggnet.umn.edu (146.57.237.1)"
    "mrs-cb-01-gi-1-26.250.ggnet.umn.edu (146.57.237.1)" -> "172.25.0.125 (172.25.0.125)";
    "172.25.0.125 (172.25.0.125)" -> "172.25.0.126 (172.25.0.126)";
    ...

A few things to note:

-   This uses the "hostname (IP address)" part of the traceroute output
    as the node name. This is unique, so if two routes pass through the
    same host, DOT will only create one node there, and run multiple
    edges to/from it. (See, for example, the initial sequence coming
    from zeus in the graph on the top right.)
-   We need to put quotes around your node names. If they're simple like
    X or Y, you don't need the quotes, but since our nodes have all
    kinds of odd characters and white space, we need to quote them.
-   For each adjacent pair of IPs in the `traceroute` output, the script
    creates an edge in the DOT file.
-   The script adds "fake" nodes at the beginning and end of the graph
    so there's a clear label for the starting and ending point. The
    starting point doesn't show up in the `traceroute` output, and the
    ending point doesn't always show up in the form that you typed when
    calling `traceroute`, so including them will make it easier for us
    to figure out what we're looking at when we combine all the results
    into a really big graph.
    -   :warning: Instead of using your "real" host, the script marks
        the starting node as "Dungeon". This way all the graphs will
        join up regardless of which client you're on.
-   Comments are allowed in DOT files using either the `//` or the
    `/* */` forms.
-   Indentation doesn't matter.
-   You can have multiple `traceroute` outputs in the same file, and
    `dot` will connect up the different sub-graphs as appropriate, or
    leave them disconnected if they never join up.
    -   This means that we can take a bunch of different DOT files from
        different groups, and with very little effort generate one big
        DOT file that will make a really nifty, big graph :smile:.

## Sharing your results

- Join the big "whole class" team on GitHub Classroom
- Clone that shared repository
-   Add your DOT file(s) to the `map` directory in your clone, commit,
    and push them up
    to Github. This will allow anyone who wants to see the full set to
    do a `git pull` on their clone and get all the current files.
    -   Use filenames that aren't likely to be used by anyone else.
        That way we avoid having to deal with any icky merge commits.
    -   :bell: Commit what you have right away, and then continue
        to commit new versions as you go. If you commit early and modify
        from there, I can start right away on building a single
        composite graph with everyone's results in one (probably
        very large) graph. My goal is to have a draft of the Big Graph
        done in lab for everyone to look at at the end of class.
-   Add your group and your target destinations you ran `traceroute` on
    to the `maps/Groups_and_destinations.md` file in the repo.
    -   You can either edit the `maps/Groups_and_destinations.md` file in your
        clone and commit and push that, or you can edit `maps/Groups_and_destinations.md`
        directly on Github via their web interface.
    - Because we're all editing the same file, merge conflicts are
      more likely here. Be careful and don't nuke someone else's work
      as you go.
