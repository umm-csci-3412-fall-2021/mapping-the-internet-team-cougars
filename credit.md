The Ruby script (`scripts/tracerouteDot.rb`) that converts the
`traceroute` data to `dot` files is based on work by Melissa Helgeson.

This lab write-up has benefitted from corrections and amendments by
Kristin Lambert and John McCall before it was converted to git, and
subsequent contributions are generally recorded as commits here.
